## What is Sail
Sail is an enterprise-level configuration center that provides a variety of features based on basic configuration file management. Compared to other configuration centers on the market, its advantage lies in its simplicity. This simplicity is not about being crude, but revolves around a series of optimized designs based on configuration files for ease of use and management. I hope it can cover all aspects of a configuration center while remaining simple. Currently, Sail supports the following capabilities:

- [x] Project-based configuration management
- [x] Management of public configurations
- [x] Namespace management
- [x] Configuration history and rollback
- [x] Support for multiple configuration formats
- [x] Fine-grained access control
- [x] Configuration encryption and decryption
- [x] **Supports native Kubernetes ConfigMap mode, no need for SDK integration.**
- [x] Multi-language support
- [ ] Release management
